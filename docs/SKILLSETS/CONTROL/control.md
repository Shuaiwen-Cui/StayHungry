- This video can be viewed as a guide for the beginners of control theory. It provides an overview of the control theory, and it is very helpful for me to understand the big picture of control theory.

- This picture is a high-level abstraction of the feedback loop control.

- My version based on my own understanding.

- Taxonomy
  - Feedforward Control - no feedback, all relies on the first principle
  - Feedback Loop Control - to tackle the part that we have no control, e.g., noise, disturbance, etc
