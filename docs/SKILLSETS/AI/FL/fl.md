# Federated Learning

## What is Federated Learning
> **Fedrated Learning** is a distributed machine learning approach which enables training of machine learning models without sharing data. The goal of federated learning is to train a high-quality shared model by training it on **decentralized devices without uploading data** from client devices to the server while protecting the privacy of client devices.
