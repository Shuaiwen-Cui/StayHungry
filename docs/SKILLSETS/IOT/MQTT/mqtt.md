# MQTT

> What is MQTT?

MQTT is a lightweight publish-subscribe messaging protocol which probably makes it the most suitable for various IoT devices. It was designed by Andy Stanford-Clark (IBM) and Arlen Nipper in 1999 for connecting Oil Pipeline telemetry systems over satellite. Since then its usage has expanded to the entire IoT industry.

> Key Elements

- **Broker**: The MQTT server which receives all messages from the clients and then routes the messages to the appropriate destination clients. The broker is the central hub for all MQTT communication.
- **Publisher**: A client which is responsible for publishing messages to the broker.
- **Subscriber**: A client which is responsible for receiving messages from the broker.

# Broker Implementations

## Mosquitto
Mosquitto is an open-source message broker that implements the MQTT protocol. It is written in C by Roger Light, and is available as a free download for Windows and Linux and is an Eclipse project.

## Emqx
Emqx is an open-source message broker that implements the MQTT protocol. It is written in Erlang and is available as a free download for Windows and Linux and is an Eclipse project.

Note: I use the emqx broker for my projects.

# Clients Implementations (Publishers and Subscribers)

Theoretically, any MQTT client can publish messages to or subscribe to topics on a broker. However, in practice, there are a few popular MQTT client implementations that are widely used.

## Paho MQTT
