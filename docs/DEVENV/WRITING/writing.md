# 📝 WRITING

## Office Word
> [Microsoft Word](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word) is a word processor developed by Microsoft. It was first released on October 25, 1983 under the name Multi-Tool Word for Xenix systems.

## Latex
> [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) is a document preparation system. When writing, the writer uses plain text as opposed to the formatted text found in "What You See Is What You Get" word processors like Microsoft Word, LibreOffice Writer and Apple Pages.

?> I use VSCode + Latex Plugins to write Latex documents, papers, most of the time.
